Adam Brill's Code Portfolio
==============

This is my first attempt creating a fully responsive site all the way from the PSDs.  It should adapt its layout so it still
looks good on all screen sizes and browsers.  I'd love to hear if you try it out and find any visual inconsistencies!

The current version of the site can be found at http://codeportfolio.adam-brill.com
